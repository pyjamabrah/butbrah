      subtitle: "Insights YOU should know but DON'T!!"
      description: "A foundational course on C programming with a hands-on journey from Machine code to Design using C. Focused on exposing the system level mechanics that will enable you to reason clearly and be confident about how the system will behave as a result. The course takes a deliberate approach - starting with the models of systems, exploring instruction set architecture, assembly code, toolchain utilities, and finally making a case for the C language."

## Why Learn C?

Like it or not - **C is the easiest language to learn!** The language has 32 keywords, all can be nicely grouped at a functional level. All you need to know is how these can be used together. That's it!

Most people just learn the language the wrong way.

## Course Philosophy

`No prior knowledge is assumed`!

The design of this course is very deliberate and geared towards someone just starting off with the C language and interested in learning in by understanding how the language controls the CPU. It very smoothly takes you from a **Noob** to a **Pro**, and this should be evident if you watched all the preview videos.

Most systems at the lower level as programmed using the C language (it can be Rust or C++ some times, but 99% of the time, it will be C).

### Why not start with 'K&R C'?
